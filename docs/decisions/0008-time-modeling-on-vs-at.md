# 0008. Time modeling: fuzzy `_on` dates vs exact `_at` instants

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-08

## Context

The model records times of two very different kinds, and treating them uniformly gets
both wrong:

- **Reading-life dates are often imprecise.** "I read this as a kid, sometime in
  1994." A plain `date` column can't hold that — it demands a specific day, so it
  forces me to invent precision I don't have and then either shows a lie ("January 1,
  1994") or needs a side hack to hide the filler.
- **System and activity instants are exact.** When a row was created, or when a
  reading session actually happened, is a precise moment.

Two independent questions decide how any given time is stored: (1) is it *fuzzy or
exact*, and (2) *who sets it* — the ORM, or me?

## Decision

Model time along two axes, signalled by a naming convention.

### Axis 1 — fuzzy (`_on`) vs exact (`_at`)

A **user-set business date is fuzzy**: stored as a real `date` *plus* a
`DatePrecision` companion (`day` / `month` / `year`, default `day`). These carry the
`_on` suffix.

| I enter | Stored date | Precision | Shown as |
|---------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| 1994 | `1994-01-01` | `year` | "1994" |
| March 1994 | `1994-03-01` | `month` | "March 1994" |
| 15 March 1994 | `1994-03-15` | `day` | "March 15, 1994" |

The value stays a genuine sortable, queryable `date` (1994 still sorts before 1995);
the precision flag only tells the UI how much of it to show, and the filler month/day
is never displayed. This applies to every `_on` field — `interested_on`,
`tbr_added_on`, `started_on`, `finished_on` (on engagements, see
[[0005-engagements-lifecycle-entity]]), `acquired_on`, and `read_on` on standalone
entries — each gaining a `<field>_precision` companion column.

**System and activity instants are exact**: the `_at` suffix, and no precision (an
exact instant has no fuzziness to record). Durations are *derived*, never stored (see
[[0004-derive-dont-store]]), and **inherit the coarser operand's precision** — so a
book discovered "1994" and started "1994" yields "about a year," never a false
"exactly 365 days."

### Axis 2 — within `_at`: audit vs activity

"Exact" does **not** mean "uneditable." Among the exact `_at` instants there are two
kinds:

- **Audit timestamps** — `created_at`, `updated_at`, via a shared `TimestampMixin`.
  The ORM sets them; they describe the *row* (when it was inserted or last modified);
  I never touch them.
- **Activity timestamps** — `logged_at` (on progress logs, see
  [[0007-progress-logs-activities-not-positions]]) and `written_at` (on reviews / blog
  posts). They describe when a real *activity* happened, default to now, and are
  **user-editable and backdatable**. `logged_at` is the "edit date" affordance: read
  last night, log it this morning, and `logged_at` is last night while `created_at`
  stays this morning. They are equal at creation and diverge only on a backdate —
  which is exactly why `logged_at` is its own column, not a reused `created_at`.

So the suffix tells you fuzzy-vs-exact (`_on` fuzzy, `_at` exact); and within exact,
audit `_at`s are ORM-owned while activity `_at`s are mine to set. (The `_on`
transition dates default sensibly at the API layer — `tbr_added_on` defaults to today
when a TBR engagement is created — but stay editable and nullable, storing the real
fact rather than reusing `created_at`, consistent with [[0004-derive-dont-store]].)

## Consequences

**Makes easy:**
- "I read this in 1994" is first-class and honest — stored, sortable, and displayed at
  exactly the precision I gave it, no invented day.
- Backdating a session (`logged_at`) never corrupts the row's audit trail
  (`created_at`); the two cannot fight.
- Durations that don't over-claim accuracy, because they inherit the coarser precision.
- A self-documenting naming rule: `_on` ⇒ fuzzy business date, `_at` ⇒ exact instant.

**What we accept:**
- Every fuzzy date costs a companion `_precision` column — two columns per business
  date.
- Display and duration logic must read the precision, not just the date.
- "Exact `_at`" being editable for *activity* timestamps is a subtlety the code and UI
  must respect — `_at` does not universally mean immutable.

## Alternatives considered

- **Plain `date` for business dates** — forces a day onto "1994," inventing precision
  and either displaying a lie or needing a separate flag anyway. The date+precision
  pair is that flag, done once and consistently.
- **Fuzzy dates as free text** ("1994", "March 1994") — loses sortability and
  queryability. Rejected; the date+precision pair keeps both.
- **Reuse `created_at` as the activity time** — conflates audit with activity, so
  backdating a session corrupts the row's insert time, and making it editable later
  needs a migration. Rejected; `logged_at` / `written_at` are their own columns.
- **A precision flag on `_at` instants too** — pointless; an exact instant has no
  fuzziness to record.

## Revisit when

A business *time* (finer than a day) is ever needed — e.g. "started reading at 9pm" —
which the day-granularity `_on` model can't express and would have to extend. Or if a
third category of timestamp appears that is neither ORM-owned audit nor user-owned
activity.
